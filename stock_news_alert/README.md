# Stock News Alert System

This project is a Python script that monitors the stock price of a specified company (Tesla Inc. in this case) and sends news alerts if the stock price changes significantly. The script integrates with multiple APIs to fetch stock prices, get relevant news articles, and send notifications via SMS.

## Features

1. **Stock Price Monitoring**: 
   - The script fetches the daily stock prices of Tesla Inc. from the Alpha Vantage API.
   - It calculates the percentage change in the stock price between yesterday and the day before yesterday.
   - If the change exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 5%), it triggers a news alert.

2. **News Fetching**:
   - The script uses the News API to get the latest news articles related to Tesla Inc.
   - It retrieves the top 3 news articles based on popularity.

3. **SMS Notifications**:
   - The script sends an SMS with the stock price change and a brief of the news articles using the Twilio API.
   - Each message includes the stock ticker, percentage change, headline, and a brief description of the news.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `twilio`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-news-alert.git
   cd stock-news-alert
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests twilio
   ```

3. Set up your API keys and authentication tokens:
   - Replace `STOCK_API_KEY` with your Alpha Vantage API key.
   - Replace `NEWS_API_KEY` with your News API key.
   - Replace `account_sid` and `auth_token` with your Twilio account SID and authentication token.

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will check the stock price changes and, if the criteria are met, fetch the latest news articles and send them via SMS.

## Configuration

- **Stock Ticker**: Modify the `STOCK` variable to change the stock symbol (default is "TSLA").
- **Company Name**: Modify the `COMPANY_NAME` variable to change the company name for news searches.
- **Phone Numbers**: Modify the `from_` and `to` phone numbers in the Twilio `client.messages.create` method to set the sender and recipient phone numbers.
